- language support, controlled from remote
- add description to products when a description is coming from server
- put stencil in production mode
- how can i implement it as a single file on a remote webserver? and without the <component> tag
- fixed font-size in the plugin
- timezone seems weird, like utcoffset(60)? why, it should just show what it sees
